Business Problem Explanation
Background

In a competitive retail environment, businesses collect large amounts of customer shopping data but often fail to convert this data into actionable insights. Without proper analysis, companies struggle to understand who their customers are, how they behave, and how to increase sales and retention.

Key Business Challenges

❌ No clear identification of New, Returning, and Loyal customers

❌ Difficulty in tracking customer purchase frequency
